Hello, my name is Wayne Page, I am an 🚀aerospace engineering✈️ Ph.D candidate at The Ohio State University. I work in adapting/applying optical flow to velocity estimation for fluid mechanics. More specifically, I work in adapting wavelet-based optical flow velocimetry from a planar velocity measurement tool to a volumetric velocity measurement tool. I work primiarily with MATLAB, but have experience with Python and C++.
